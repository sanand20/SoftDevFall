Ear: 
- What is the purpose of the debug lines?
- What is the purpose of the "tuple"?

- Why are the inputs of the functions loops (if that's what they are)?
- Why use multiple functions (objectively) instead of one?

Comments:

Pasta Noodles:
- They have multiline comments which is interesting.
- Using different methods for each section of the code seems like a good practice.

Concerns:
