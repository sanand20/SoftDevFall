#### Workflow
* Dynamic duos pulled Notes and Code repos for the 18_css directory
* We got started on adding CSS to the html code provided in 18_css with an aim to make it appear like the target_styling.png


#### Notes
* There are 3 ways to add CSS to an HTML file (Inline, Internal, and External)
* Inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to single elements
  * <p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>
* Internal CSS is used 
  * <style>
body {
  background-color: linen;
}

h1 {
  color: maroon;
  margin-left: 40px;
}
</style>

#### Next LCT
* John von Neumann (jvn@stuy.edu)

Note the horizontal line below. Use it effectively.
