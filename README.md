## Monday 2021-11-22 :: K18: Comic Sans Syndrome :: by Shriya Anand

#### Workflow
* Dynamic duos pulled Notes and Code repos for the 18_css directory
* We got started on adding CSS to the html code provided in 18_css with an aim to make it appear like the target_styling.png


#### Notes
* There are 3 ways to add CSS to an HTML file (Inline, Internal, and External)
* Inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to single elements. It works by adding the "style" attribute specifically next to the relevant element.
* Internal CSS is used for larger sections (like head/body). It works by adding specific design choices to the <style> element inside the respective section of the page (eg: head).
* External CSS is used to change the entire website using a single file. It works by linking the CSS file in the HTML file and having the CSS file control the style of the entire website.

#### Homework

* Apply styling to index.html to mimic target_styling.png with 3 different approaches (Inline, Internal, and External CSS)
