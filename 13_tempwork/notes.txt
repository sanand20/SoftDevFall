K13 -- Occupation Flask App Template

In the app file, we simply ran the functions from the occupations.py file. 

We made sure that the route was /occupyflaskst.

Once we got the dictionary of jobs and randomly chosen occupation, we were able to input this data into the 'tablified.html' template using render_template.

In order to access files such as the occupations.csv or occupations.py we had to use "./data/occupations.csv" to indicate the location of the files.

EGO:

The main point is to be receptive about advice/correction and not get defensive if you make an error or are confused about something.
