BlueGreen (Edwin Zheng, Shriya Anand, Zhaoyu Lin)

We noticed in the terminal that our input was stored in the request arguments as a dictionary, so we accessed the dictionary and got the value for the key "username" and returned that in the web page.
Since this approach worked, we were able to create an html template called response.html with inputs "response" and "response_method."
By accessing the dictionary and using the render template we took the inputs of the user and placed them in the html template, thus producing a page that displayed their response.
