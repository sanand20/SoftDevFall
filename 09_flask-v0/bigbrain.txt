Q0: Where have you seen similar syntax in other langs?
We have seen this kind of syntax in Java, where you have to declare the type before declaring an object.

Q1: What points of reference do you have for meaning of '/'?
Usually, when we see a "/" in this environment, we assume that is being used to separate directories or files. This could represent storing the app in a directory such as the home directory.

Q2: Where will this print to? Q3: What will it print?
This depends on how you are running the file. If we directly run this file, it will print "_main_" in the command line or idle. If the file is being imported and run, it will print the file name.

Q3: Will this appear anywhere? How u know?
Yes, this will appear if hello_world() is called because the function would then return such string.

Q4: Where have you seen similar construcs in other languages?
This construct is similar to those in Java, where methods associated with certain objects can be called in such manner. An example would be arrayList.get(0).
